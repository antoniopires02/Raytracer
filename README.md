# Mathematics for Computer Graphics ‚Äì Practical Exercises in Python

This repository contains a series of practical exercises developed for the **Mathematics for Computer Graphics** course, using **Python**.

## üß† Topics Covered

- Linear algebra and vector operations
- Coordinate systems and transformations
- Matrix multiplication and homogeneous coordinates
- 2D and 3D projections
- Intersections and ray equations
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
- Building a basic **raytracer** from scratch

## üöÄ Learning Outcomes

By completing the exercises in this repository, students will:

- Develop strong foundations in the mathematics behind computer graphics.
- Gain hands-on experience implementing concepts using Python.
- Learn and apply object-oriented programming principles.
- Be capable of building a **simple raytracer**, combining math and OOP.

## üìÅ Structure
This repository contains 10 graded practical exercises for the Mathematics for Computer Graphics course, implemented in Python.
Organized into 10 folders, each exercise is self-contained and progressively builds on the previous ones, combining mathematical concepts and object-oriented programming (OOP).
This structured progression guides students step-by-step through both the theory and practice needed to develop a simple raytracer from scratch, reinforcing key skills in mathematics and software design along the way.
